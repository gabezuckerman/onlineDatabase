# Relational database architechure

On the google drive, the raw data is roughly stored in this format:

![](puma_db_graph.png)

To add data, you need to format the data to match the 4 leftmost tables and run the `addToDB.R` script.

# 1.) the animals table

The animals tables is formatted like this (used the arrows to see additional rows and columns):


```{r animals, layout="l-body-outset"}
head(fread("newDatabaseFiles/animals.csv"), 20) %>% paged_table(options = list(cols.print = 5))
```

Important additional info: `species_code` 1 means elk, `species_code` 2 means wolf (though think I removed them from this iteration of the database)

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
